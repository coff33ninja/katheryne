here is a conversation I had with a friend that provided some intresting suggestions for the ai to function

Okay so I have a working api that gathers the nessesary data, character, farming locations, bosses mobs, domains, etc. now I need a list of questions or training guidelines to use like what character uses this boss and the response must be the dropped items aswell as the items that boss will provide for character. Then suggest user what stats the user must look put for.

Below is a list of sample training prompts and guidelines that you can use to create training examples for your model. These examples are designed to prompt responses that include:

• The specific boss or farming location,
• The items or materials the boss drops (or that can be obtained there),
• Which characters or builds benefit from those drops, and
• The key stat thresholds or priorities players should aim for.

You can adjust the phrasing and details as needed to match your data structure and domain specifics.
Sample Training Prompts

    Direct Boss Query:
        Prompt:
        “For the boss [Boss Name] in [Region], which drops are most beneficial for [Character Name]’s build? List the items provided and the key stat values (e.g., Crit Rate, ATK, Elemental Mastery) that players should look for.”
        Guideline:
        The response should include a list of drop items/materials, an explanation of how each item benefits [Character Name] (e.g., boosts DPS, increases elemental reaction damage), and recommended stat ranges.

    Farming Location & Character Build:
        Prompt:
        “Which farming domain or boss in [Region] provides the ideal ascension materials for [Character Name]? Detail the drop items and explain which artifact or weapon stats are crucial for optimizing [Character Name].”
        Guideline:
        The answer should specify the farming location or boss, list the ascension materials, and offer suggestions such as “look for artifacts with at least 7-8% Crit Rate or 50% Crit Damage” (depending on the character’s needs).

    Meta-Build Recommendation:
        Prompt:
        “What are the recommended drops from [Boss Name] to maximize the DPS for [Character Name]? Include the list of items, their sources, and the specific stat bonuses (e.g., ATK, Elemental Damage Bonus) that contribute to an optimal build.”
        Guideline:
        The response must provide both the item names and a rationale for each, linking the items to stat enhancements that directly benefit [Character Name]’s performance.

    Comparative Query:
        Prompt:
        “Between bosses [Boss A] and [Boss B] in [Region], which one offers better drops for [Character Name]? Provide a comparison of the materials and indicate the ideal stats each item should have.”
        Guideline:
        The answer should compare the two sources, listing the drop items from each and suggesting which set of drops offers better stat potential for the character’s build (e.g., “Boss A drops offer higher base ATK while Boss B provides more consistent Crit stats”).

    General Farming Strategy:
        Prompt:
        “What farming strategy would you recommend for obtaining key materials for [Character Name]? Include which bosses or domains to farm, the expected drop items, and what stat thresholds to prioritize when evaluating these items.”
        Guideline:
        The model’s response should outline a strategy that covers multiple aspects: which locations to target, what items to expect, and the minimum desirable stat levels (for example, “aim for artifacts with at least 12% ATK or a 4-piece set bonus that increases elemental damage”).

    Item-Build Integration:
        Prompt:
        “How do the drops from [Boss Name] integrate into an optimal build for [Character Name]? Provide a list of the boss drops, explain how each item contributes to the build, and mention which stats (e.g., Crit Damage, Energy Recharge) are most important.”
        Guideline:
        The response should be structured to first list the items, then provide an explanation for each item’s role, and finish with clear stat priorities for the build.

Training Guidelines Summary

    Content Requirements:
    Ensure every answer contains the name of the boss or domain, the list of dropped items/materials, and a breakdown of how those items benefit a specific character or build. Include concrete stat recommendations (like ideal percentages for Crit Rate, ATK, Elemental Mastery, etc.).

    Consistency:
    Maintain consistency in terminology (e.g., always refer to “boss drops” or “ascension materials”) and ensure that every response follows a similar structure so the model learns the desired format.

    Flexibility:
    Include variations where sometimes the prompt might be very specific (naming a particular boss and character) and sometimes more general (asking for the best farming strategy for a type of character). This helps the model generalize better.

    Data Anchoring:
    Make sure that the training examples are grounded in actual game data from your API. For example, if your API returns a list of items with associated stat bonuses, incorporate that data into the responses.

    Iterative Feedback:
    Once you begin training, use a few sample queries to test the model’s responses. Fine-tune your training examples based on whether the outputs correctly match your desired format and content.

This framework should help you build a robust training set for your specialized AI. Would you like additional examples or further breakdowns of any specific prompt type?
You said:
Yes please provide as much detail as possible even if you have to break you max output per gpt model

Below is an extensive, multi-part guide with sample training prompts, guidelines, and structure suggestions for building a dataset that teaches your model to answer questions about Genshin Impact farming, boss drops, artifact recommendations, and stat priorities. You can break these examples into multiple training examples for your model.
Part 1: General Principles for Training Data Creation

A. Consistency and Structure

    Input Format: Define a prompt structure that always includes key elements: the query context (e.g., boss name, region, or domain), the target character (if applicable), and the specific information requested (e.g., “what drops”, “recommended stats”).
    Output Format: Ensure the answer always returns:
        A list of drop items or materials (with names and brief descriptions).
        Contextual explanation on how each item benefits a particular build or character.
        Specific stat recommendations (e.g., “aim for at least 7-8% Crit Rate,” “50+ ATK”, “high Elemental Mastery”) and an explanation of why these thresholds are important.
        Sometimes, a recommendation for a farming strategy or a comparative analysis when multiple sources are available.

B. Data Anchoring

    Use actual drop data from your API. For example, if your API returns a JSON with boss details and drops, embed this information into your training responses.
    Mention specific regions or domains (e.g., “Spiral Abyss Chamber 3,” “Domain of Guyun”) to ground the answers in in-game reality.

C. Variation in Prompts

    Some prompts should be very specific (targeting a particular boss and character), while others are more general (asking for the best farming strategy for a set of materials).
    Include comparative questions as well as direct queries to help your model generalize.

Part 2: Detailed Sample Training Prompts & Guidelines
1. Direct Boss Query

Prompt Example:

For the boss "Stormterror Dvalin" in Mondstadt, what are the recommended drops for building a main DPS character like Diluc? Please list the dropped materials and suggest the key artifact stats that would maximize Diluc's damage output.

Expected Response Guideline:

    Boss Drops: List items such as "Dvalin's Plume," "Dvalin's Claw," etc.
    Explanation: Explain how these items help—e.g., “Dvalin's Plume provides a high base ATK, which synergizes well with Diluc’s Pyro abilities.”
    Stat Recommendations:
        Artifact main stats: “ATK% or Pyro DMG Bonus,”
        Substats: “7–8% Crit Rate and 50–60% Crit Damage.”
    Formatting: Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.

2. Farming Location & Character Build

Prompt Example:

Which domain in Liyue provides the best ascension materials for Ganyu’s build? Include a list of the drops, and advise which artifact stats are critical for enhancing her Cryo abilities.

Expected Response Guideline:

    Farming Domain: Identify the domain (e.g., “Domain of Guyun”).
    Drops List: Enumerate drops like “Mist Veiled Lead” or other materials.
    Build Explanation: Describe how these materials support Ganyu’s Cryo DPS build.
    Stat Guidelines:
        Prioritize “Crit Rate and Crit Damage” for her, and mention “Hydro-related boosts if applicable (for synergy, even if Ganyu is Cryo).”

3. Meta-Build and Item-Build Integration

Prompt Example:

What are the optimal drops from the boss "Childe" for a Hydro main DPS build, and what artifact stats should a player focus on? Provide a detailed explanation.

Expected Response Guideline:

    Drop Items: List items such as “Childe’s Hydro Sigil,” “Elemental Shard,” etc.
    Role Explanation: Describe how these drops feed into the build—e.g., “The Hydro Sigil increases Hydro DMG bonus, which is essential for triggering Vaporize with a Pyro support.”
    Artifact Stats:
        Recommended main stats: “Hydro DMG Bonus on Sands, ATK% or Crit Rate on Goblet, and Crit Damage on Circlet.”
        Include thresholds: “For instance, aim for a minimum of 6–7% Crit Rate and 50–55% Crit Damage.”
    Additional Advice: Optionally, compare how these drops might be more favorable than another boss’s drops.

4. Comparative Query Between Two Sources

Prompt Example:

Compare the farming benefits between the bosses "Stormterror Dvalin" and "Andrius" for a character that relies on high ATK and Crit stats. Which boss offers better drop materials, and what stat thresholds should be prioritized?

Expected Response Guideline:

    Comparison Section:
        Stormterror Dvalin: List its drops and highlight that they generally boost ATK (e.g., “Dvalin's Plume provides higher base ATK”).
        Andrius: Detail its drops, possibly noting that they may offer better substats or Crit-related bonuses.
    Stat Prioritization:
        “For a build emphasizing Crit, Andrius might offer better materials if it provides drops with natural Crit Rate increases, whereas Dvalin is better for raw ATK.”
    Conclusion: Conclude with a recommendation based on the character’s needs, e.g., “If you’re focusing on high Crit Damage, aim for materials from Andrius with at least 8–10% Crit Rate.”

5. General Farming Strategy

Prompt Example:

What farming strategy do you recommend for obtaining key ascension materials for a Pyro character such as Xiangling? Include which bosses or domains to farm, the list of expected drops, and the stat thresholds you should target on artifacts.

Expected Response Guideline:

    Strategy Outline:
        Identify relevant farming locations, e.g., “Spiral Abyss Chamber 3 for Xiangling’s ascension materials and the Domain of Guyun for additional artifacts.”
    Drops and Benefits:
        List key items and their benefits (e.g., “Xiangling’s domain may drop Pyro-enhancing materials that provide bonus elemental DMG, essential for her DPS build.”)
    Artifact Stat Thresholds:
        For a Pyro DPS: “Prioritize ATK%, Pyro DMG Bonus, and Crit stats; aim for artifacts with at least 6–8% Crit Rate and 50%+ Crit Damage.”
    Additional Tips:
        “Use co-op mode to farm these domains more efficiently and focus on time-limited events that may provide rare drops.”

6. Contextual Question Involving Drop Integration

Prompt Example:

How do the drops from the domain "Momiji’s Chamber" integrate into an optimal build for a support character like Bennett? List the items, explain their benefits, and mention which artifact substats (such as Energy Recharge or ATK%) are most beneficial.

Expected Response Guideline:

    Domain Details:
        Clearly state the domain (“Momiji’s Chamber”) and the expected drops (e.g., “Mora, specific ascension materials, and artifact components”).
    Build Integration:
        Explain how each item supports Bennett’s role as a support/healer, such as “providing Energy Recharge to ensure frequent Elemental Burst usage.”
    Artifact Substats:
        Provide specific recommendations: “Aim for artifacts with at least 10–12% Energy Recharge and a bonus to ATK or HP, which scales with Bennett’s healing and buff capabilities.”

Part 3: Dataset Formatting and Augmenting with Retrieval

A. Structuring the Data:

    Each training example should ideally be in a JSON or CSV format that pairs a “prompt” with an “ideal response.”
    For instance:

    {
      "prompt": "For the boss 'Andrius' in Mondstadt, list the recommended drops for building a high-crit character and suggest stat thresholds for artifacts.",
      "response": "Andrius drops include [list items]. For a high-crit build, focus on artifacts with 7-8% Crit Rate and 50-55% Crit Damage. [Detailed explanation...]"
    }

B. Retrieval-Augmented Generation:

    Once your dataset is stored, you can index these examples using vector search (via FAISS) so that during inference your model can retrieve similar examples as context.
    This allows the model to reference concrete data from your dataset when answering user queries.

C. Automating Data Updates:

    Ensure your scraping or API pipeline (as described in Part 1) updates the raw data periodically.
    Use a script to automatically re-generate training examples (or adjust existing ones) based on updated drop rates, new bosses, or changes in meta.

Part 4: Implementation Tips & Best Practices

    Iteration and Testing:
        Initially run a few examples through your training pipeline and manually check the output.
        Use user feedback (e.g., from alpha testers) to refine both the prompts and the expected responses.

    Error Handling:
        Your dataset may include some incomplete data or inconsistent formatting. Build error-handling into your scraping and parsing scripts to ensure data quality.

    Expand Over Time:
        As more in-game data becomes available (especially when new regions or characters are released), create additional training examples following the same template.
        Maintain versioning so you know which training examples correspond to which patch or update of the game.

    Leverage Community Insights:
        Incorporate community-vetted stat thresholds and build recommendations. This increases the accuracy and trustworthiness of your responses.

    Documentation:
        Document each training example and guideline so that you can easily update the dataset or troubleshoot issues in the training process.

By using these detailed training prompts and guidelines, you’ll be well on your way to building a domain-specific model that can accurately advise players on farming, boss drops, and build optimizations in Genshin Impact. This setup, combined with an automated data pipeline, will allow your model to continuously improve as new data becomes available.

Do you need further breakdowns on any specific prompt type or additional code examples for integrating this with your training pipeline?
You said:
Further breakdowns like character constellation follow-up signature weapons or suggest alt if not available. Anything

Below is an extended breakdown of training examples that incorporate additional nuance—such as character constellations, signature weapon recommendations, and fallback suggestions if signature weapons aren’t available. You can use these examples to guide your model’s responses, ensuring that it not only lists boss drops and stat recommendations but also suggests follow-ups based on a character’s constellation level or current inventory. Each example includes the prompt structure, expected response breakdown, and key guidelines.
Detailed Training Example 1: Character Constellation and Signature Weapon Query

Prompt Example:

For the character "Diluc" with a 2-star constellation, what are the recommended drops from the boss "Stormterror Dvalin" to enhance his build? Also, what is his signature weapon, and if it’s not available, suggest an alternative. Include the ideal artifact stat thresholds.

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Boss Drops:
        List the specific items/materials dropped by Stormterror Dvalin (e.g., "Dvalin's Plume," "Dvalin's Claw").
        Explain how each drop contributes to Diluc's build (e.g., “The high base ATK from Dvalin's Plume is key to boosting Diluc’s damage output.”)

    Constellation Considerations:
        Mention that with a 2-star constellation, certain bonuses are unlocked (e.g., “At 2-star, Diluc gains [specific ability] that benefits from higher Crit Rate or ATK”).
        Provide follow-up advice such as “Further constellations enhance his elemental burst, so focus on items that also boost Pyro DMG Bonus.”

    Signature Weapon and Alternatives:
        State his signature weapon (e.g., “Diluc’s signature weapon is the [Name of Signature Weapon] which provides excellent ATK and Pyro DMG Bonus”).
        If his signature weapon isn’t available, suggest a fallback alternative (e.g., “If you can’t obtain the signature, the [Alternate Weapon Name] is a viable option, offering similar benefits but with slightly lower Crit stats.”)

    Artifact Stat Recommendations:
        Advise on the main stats and substats to look for: “Aim for artifacts with ATK% on Sands, Pyro DMG Bonus on Goblet, and Crit Damage on Circlet. A minimum threshold of 7–8% Crit Rate and 50–55% Crit Damage is recommended.”

Guidelines:

    The response must clearly connect constellation level with any additional bonuses or build changes.
    It should include a conditional section that checks if the signature weapon is available; if not, provide an alternative with a brief rationale.

Detailed Training Example 2: Fallback Alternatives and Build Adjustments

Prompt Example:

For the character "Ganyu" at constellation level 4, what farming strategy should I use in the domain "Guyun" to maximize her Cryo build? List the boss drops, recommended artifacts, and if her signature bow is unavailable, suggest a competitive alternative along with ideal stat thresholds.

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Farming Strategy Overview:
        Identify the key farming location ("Domain of Guyun") and explain why it’s beneficial for Ganyu’s Cryo build (e.g., “This domain provides ascension materials that specifically boost Cryo DMG and elemental burst efficiency.”)

    Drop Items:
        List the materials dropped from the domain, along with their role (e.g., “The domain drops include [Item A] and [Item B] which are essential for Ganyu’s ascension.”)

    Artifact Recommendations:
        Recommend artifact sets or main stats (e.g., “Prioritize artifacts with Crit Rate, Crit Damage, and Cryo DMG Bonus. Ideally, look for 8% Crit Rate and 55% Crit Damage as substats.”)

    Signature Weapon and Alternatives:
        State her signature bow, if applicable, and describe its benefits.
        Provide a fallback option: “If Ganyu’s signature bow isn’t available, the [Alternate Bow Name] is a competitive alternative that offers similar base ATK and additional Crit Rate, which suits her build well.”

    Constellation Impact:
        Explain any specific build adjustments due to her being at constellation level 4 (e.g., “At constellation level 4, Ganyu gains a bonus to charged attack damage, so prioritize items that further enhance her elemental burst damage.”)

Guidelines:

    Ensure the answer is segmented into clear sections (farming strategy, drop items, artifacts, weapon recommendation).
    Emphasize conditional advice (i.e., “if signature weapon is not available, then suggest…”).
    Link the constellation level to build adjustments and stat priorities.

Detailed Training Example 3: Comparative Query with Fallback Suggestions

Prompt Example:

Compare the drops from the bosses "Andrius" and "Stormterror Dvalin" for building a high-crit support for Bennett. Which boss provides more useful materials for his build? Also, include a recommendation on his signature catalyst and suggest a fallback if needed. Provide ideal stat thresholds for his artifacts.

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Comparison of Boss Drops:
        Provide a brief overview of the drops from Andrius and Dvalin, noting differences (e.g., “Andrius drops include items that boost Crit Rate more consistently, while Dvalin’s drops offer higher base ATK.”)
        Evaluate which set is more suitable for Bennett’s support role (e.g., “For Bennett’s role as a support and healer, the drops from Andrius might be more beneficial because they enhance his elemental burst efficiency.”)

    Signature Catalyst Recommendation:
        Specify his signature catalyst and its benefits (e.g., “Bennett’s signature catalyst provides a bonus to Energy Recharge and HP, crucial for his support abilities.”)
        Include a conditional clause: “If this catalyst is not available, then the [Alternative Catalyst Name] is recommended due to its similar bonuses.”

    Artifact and Stat Prioritization:
        List recommended artifacts for Bennett with stat thresholds: “Aim for artifacts with HP%, Energy Recharge, and ATK%, ideally with at least 10-12% Energy Recharge and bonus HP values.”
        Mention why these stats support his role.

    Overall Recommendation:
        Summarize the comparative advantages, linking the recommendations back to the character’s build and role.

Guidelines:

    Use clear comparative language, contrasting the pros and cons of each boss drop set.
    Provide fallback recommendations in case the signature weapon or catalyst isn’t available.
    Ensure that stat thresholds are specific and justifiable based on the character’s needs.

Additional Tips for Training Data Creation

    Modular Prompts:
    Create modular training examples where each section (boss drops, weapons, constellations, artifacts) can be updated independently as game data changes.

    Use Structured Data:
    If your API returns JSON objects with fields like "bossName," "drops," "signatureWeapon," "artifactStats," etc., embed these into your training examples. For instance:

    {
      "prompt": "For character 'Xiangling' with constellation level 3, list the recommended boss drops from 'Lavawalker' and suggest her signature weapon along with an alternative if needed.",
      "response": "Lavawalker drops include: [Item1, Item2]. Xiangling’s signature weapon is the 'Dragonspine Spear'. If unavailable, the 'Flamebringer Polearm' is a good alternative. Prioritize artifacts with 7% Crit Rate and 55% Crit Damage."
    }

    Feedback Loop:
    After initial training, test the model with real user queries. Refine the training examples by incorporating any gaps or additional nuance required, such as more granular details about how constellation effects influence build priorities.

These detailed breakdowns should help you build a comprehensive training dataset that covers a wide range of queries—from direct boss questions to comparative analysis and fallback recommendations based on character constellations and weapon availability. This structure will allow your model to provide nuanced, game-specific advice to users.

Would you like any further examples or additional guidance on a specific part of the pipeline?
You said:
Sure go ahead 

Below are additional training examples and guidelines that further break down the nuances of character constellations, signature weapons, and fallback recommendations. These examples are designed to enrich your dataset and teach your model to respond dynamically when, for instance, a signature item isn’t available or when constellation bonuses come into play.
Example 7: Character Constellation Follow-Up with Signature Weapon Details

Prompt:

For the character "Klee" at constellation level 3, what are the ideal boss drops from the domain "Spark of Destiny" for her Pyro build? Include details on her signature catalyst and suggest an alternative if it isn’t available, along with recommended artifact stat thresholds.

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Domain Drops:
        List Items:
            "Spark Shard" – boosts base Pyro DMG
            "Flame Core" – increases elemental burst efficiency
        Usage Explanation:
            Explain that these drops enhance Klee’s Pyro abilities and synergize with her burst damage.

    Constellation Impact:
        Mention that at constellation level 3, Klee gains improved charged attack performance or burst enhancements.
        Advise on any additional material needs if a higher constellation bonus is desired.

    Signature Catalyst Details:
        Signature:
            “Klee’s signature catalyst, [Catalyst Name], offers a significant Pyro DMG Bonus and Energy Recharge boost.”
        Fallback:
            “If this catalyst isn’t available, the [Alternative Catalyst Name] provides similar benefits with slightly lower base stats.”

    Artifact Recommendations:
        Main Stats:
            Sands: ATK% or Pyro DMG Bonus
            Goblet: Pyro DMG Bonus
            Circlet: Crit Rate or Crit Damage
        Thresholds:
            Aim for a minimum of 7–8% Crit Rate and 50–55% Crit Damage.

    Formatting and Clarity:
        Use bullet points or numbered lists to structure the output, ensuring each section is clearly delineated.

Example 8: Fallback Alternative with Constellation and Weapon Suggestions

Prompt:

For the character "Xiao" at constellation level 5, what are the best boss drops from "Stormbreaker" to enhance his Anemo build? Additionally, if his signature polearm is not available, what alternative weapon should be used, and what artifact stats are critical for maximizing his plunge attack damage?

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Boss Drops from "Stormbreaker":
        List of Drops:
            "Wind Shard" – increases overall ATK
            "Sky Essence" – boosts Anemo DMG Bonus
        Usage Explanation:
            Describe how these items are essential for Xiao’s ascension and help improve his plunge attack efficiency.

    Constellation Consideration:
        Explain that at constellation level 5, Xiao receives a bonus that increases his plunge DMG significantly.
        Advise on how additional materials may further enhance this bonus.

    Weapon Recommendation:
        Signature Weapon:
            “Xiao’s ideal weapon is [Signature Polearm], which offers a high base ATK and bonus Anemo DMG.”
        Fallback Alternative:
            “If this weapon is unavailable, the [Alternative Polearm Name] is a strong substitute due to its similar ATK scaling and bonus effects.”

    Artifact Stat Guidelines:
        Recommend artifacts with:
            Sands: ATK%
            Goblet: Anemo DMG Bonus
            Circlet: Crit Rate or Crit Damage
        Suggest minimum substat thresholds: “Aim for at least 8% Crit Rate and 55% Crit Damage to maximize plunge attack potential.”

    Overall Structure:
        The answer should be divided into clear sections (Boss Drops, Constellation Impact, Weapon Recommendation, and Artifact Stats) with detailed bullet points for clarity.

Example 9: Comparative Query with Alt Suggestions and Advanced Fallbacks

Prompt:

Compare the farming benefits of bosses "Andrius" and "Dvalin" for enhancing Bennett’s support build. Which source provides better drops for his catalyst and artifacts? Include signature item recommendations and suggest suitable alternatives if his preferred catalyst is not available. Also, provide stat thresholds for Energy Recharge and HP that Bennett should target.

Expected Response Breakdown:

    Comparative Analysis of Boss Drops:
        Andrius Drops:
            List items that boost Crit stats and may have inherent Energy Recharge bonuses.
        Dvalin Drops:
            Mention drops that contribute to raw ATK and support scaling.
        Comparison:
            Conclude which set is more aligned with Bennett’s support role (e.g., “For Bennett’s support role, Andrius drops are generally better because they improve his Energy Recharge and Crit stats, which are crucial for his burst healing and buff capabilities.”)

    Signature Catalyst and Alternatives:
        Preferred Catalyst:
            “Bennett’s signature catalyst is [Signature Catalyst Name], known for boosting Energy Recharge and HP.”
        Fallback Alternative:
            “If unavailable, the [Alternative Catalyst Name] is recommended as it offers similar bonuses.”

    Artifact Stat Recommendations:
        Key Stats:
            Energy Recharge: Aim for 10–12%
            HP: Look for artifacts that provide significant HP%
        Additional Considerations:
            Include possible substat ranges and how these stats synergize with Bennett’s abilities.

    Final Recommendation:
        Summarize by advising a balanced approach: “Based on the analysis, focus on Andrius for better Energy Recharge materials and ensure that your artifacts have the specified thresholds to maximize Bennett’s support potential.”

Implementation Tips for These Examples

    Structured JSON Format:
    Consider storing each training pair as a JSON object. For example:

    {
      "prompt": "For the character 'Xiao' at constellation level 5, what are the best boss drops from 'Stormbreaker' to enhance his Anemo build? Additionally, if his signature polearm is not available, what alternative weapon should be used, and what artifact stats are critical for maximizing his plunge attack damage?",
      "response": "Stormbreaker drops include: 1. Wind Shard – increases overall ATK; 2. Sky Essence – boosts Anemo DMG Bonus. At constellation level 5, Xiao gains a bonus that significantly increases plunge DMG. His signature weapon is [Signature Polearm], which provides high base ATK and bonus Anemo DMG. If unavailable, the [Alternative Polearm Name] serves as a viable substitute. For artifacts, prioritize Sands with ATK%, Goblet with Anemo DMG Bonus, and Circlet with either Crit Rate (min 8%) or Crit Damage (min 55%)."
    }

    Iterative Refinement:
    After setting up initial training pairs, run a few queries through your model and evaluate its responses. Adjust the examples based on feedback, ensuring that every nuance (such as fallback alternatives or constellation effects) is covered accurately.

    Coverage:
    Ensure that your dataset includes examples for all major characters, regions, and scenarios, so your model can generalize across various queries.

    Versioning and Updates:
    As the game meta evolves (e.g., new boss drops, new weapons, or changes in constellation bonuses), update your dataset and add new training examples. You can even automate this by linking parts of your dataset to your API that scrapes current in-game data.

These detailed examples and guidelines should help you create a comprehensive training dataset that covers not only the basic queries about farming and boss drops but also more nuanced questions involving character constellations, signature weapons, and fallback recommendations. This depth of training will enable your model to provide highly tailored and useful responses to Genshin Impact players.

Do you need further elaboration on any of these sections, additional prompt types, or integration tips for the retrieval mechanism?

Lets also add help me build my team for whatever type of even and elemental request by any type of domain or even and the user must list their characters. Then the ai must list weapons, artifacts and teamups with their own sets.

Below is an additional prompt type focused on team composition—one where the user specifies the characters they have along with an event, domain, or elemental request, and the AI must provide recommendations for weapons, artifacts, and synergistic team-ups (including alternative sets).
Additional Prompt Type: Team Composition and Build Query
Sample Prompt Example

Help me build my team for a Dendro-focused event. I currently have the characters: Ningguang, Xiao, and Bennett. Based on my roster and the event's elemental requirements, what weapons, artifact sets, and additional team members would you recommend? Please include fallback options if signature items or main roles are not available.

Expected Response Breakdown

    Team Overview and Analysis:
        User Inventory Acknowledgement:
            Start by listing the user’s provided characters (e.g., Ningguang, Xiao, Bennett) and briefly describe their roles (e.g., Ningguang as a Geo DPS/support, Xiao as a primary DPS, Bennett as a support/healer).
        Event and Elemental Context:
            Mention that the event is Dendro-focused and explain why integrating Dendro synergy is important for this scenario (e.g., to trigger reactions like Quicken or Bloom).

    Weapon Recommendations:
        For Each Character (or Role):
            Ningguang:
                Signature Weapon: Recommend her ideal catalyst (e.g., “Recommended: [Ningguang’s Signature Catalyst] that boosts Geo DMG and HP”).
                Fallback: If unavailable, suggest an alternative (e.g., “If unavailable, try [Alternative Catalyst Name] which offers similar bonus effects.”)
            Xiao:
                Signature Polearm: List his preferred weapon with benefits (e.g., “Ideal: [Xiao’s Signature Polearm] that maximizes plunge attack damage and Crit stats”).

                Fallback Option: Include an alternative recommendation.

    Artifact Set Recommendations:
        Per Character:
            Suggest ideal artifact main stats and substats for each character. For example:
                Ningguang:
                    Sands: ATK% or Geo DMG Bonus
                    Goblet: Geo DMG Bonus
                    Circlet: Crit Rate or Crit Damage
                    Thresholds: “Aim for at least 7–8% Crit Rate and 50–55% Crit Damage.”
                Xiao:
                    Recommend artifacts that focus on ATK%, Anemo DMG Bonus, and high Crit Damage.
                Bennett:
                    Recommend artifacts with high Energy Recharge and HP, plus supportive substats.
        General Fallbacks:
            If the ideal artifact sets are not available, list alternatives that still provide strong synergy (e.g., “If the recommended 4-piece set is unavailable, consider mixing sets that provide partial bonuses with ideal main stats.”)

    Team-Up Suggestions and Additional Members:
        Complementary Characters:
            Based on the event's Dendro focus, recommend additional characters to round out the team. For instance:
                “For better Dendro synergy, consider adding a Dendro character such as Collei or Nahida, which can trigger Bloom reactions with Ningguang’s Geo and further enhance elemental reactions.”
        Synergy Explanation:
            Explain how the recommended additional characters will improve overall team performance (e.g., “Adding a Dendro support will help trigger Quicken and Bloom, thereby boosting overall damage output and energy regeneration for the team.”)

    Fallback and Adaptation Strategy:
        Missing Key Items:
            If any signature weapons or artifact sets aren’t available, provide alternative strategies such as focusing on secondary stat upgrades or farming additional domains for alternative materials.

            End with a concise summary that outlines the final recommendations for weapons, artifacts, and additional team members along with key stat targets.

Detailed Guidelines for Training the Model

    Consistency:
    Every training example should maintain a clear, consistent structure:
        Acknowledge the user’s current roster.
        Define the event or elemental focus.
        Provide tailored recommendations for each character’s weapon and artifacts.
        Suggest additional characters to complete the team for better synergy.
        Include fallback strategies for unavailable items.

    Data Anchoring:
    Each recommended item (weapon, artifact, additional team member) should be linked to data from your API. For example, if your API returns drop rates or specific stats for items, embed that data (e.g., “Weapon X offers 15% ATK boost and has a 20% drop rate from Boss Y”) into the training response.

    Conditional Logic:
    Train the model to check for availability:
        “If signature weapon A is not available, then suggest alternative B.”
        Use conditional phrases like “if unavailable” or “fallback option” to encourage the model to provide alternatives.

    Nuance in Stat Recommendations:
    Provide concrete numbers and thresholds in every response. For example, artifact stat recommendations should include target percentages (e.g., “aim for at least 7–8% Crit Rate”).
        You might include phrases like “based on the ideal build data, the recommended stat thresholds are…” to emphasize data-driven advice.

    Multi-Step Reasoning:
    Encourage the model to provide multi-step instructions that begin with acknowledging current assets, then identifying gaps (if any), and finally suggesting how to overcome those gaps through alternative farming methods or fallback recommendations.

    Variability:
    Include examples that vary by event type, elemental focus, and character roles (e.g., main DPS, support, healer). This ensures the model can handle a broad range of queries.

    Context Awareness:
    The model should be trained to interpret both the characters provided and the event or domain context to provide the most relevant advice.

Additional Example: Combined Team Composition Query

    Additional Team Members:
        Suggest adding a Dendro character (like Collei or Nahida) to boost the elemental synergy.
    Fallback Strategies:
        Provide alternative farming routes or item sources if primary drops are scarce.
    Final Summary:
        Conclude with a concise summary that lists the recommended set for weapons, artifacts, and extra team members along with key stat targets.
