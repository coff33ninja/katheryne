## System Overview

Katheryne is a conversational AI assistant specialized in Genshin Impact game knowledge. The system uses a PyTorch-based sequence-to-sequence model to process natural language queries about the game and generate structured, informative responses.

### Purpose and Goals

Katheryne aims to provide Genshin Impact players with accurate, detailed information about various aspects of the game, including:

- Character builds, abilities, and constellations
- Weapon stats and recommendations
- Artifact set bonuses and optimal stats
- Domain farming strategies
- Team composition advice and synergies

The assistant is designed to understand natural language queries and provide structured, contextually relevant responses that help players optimize their gameplay experience.

### System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Data Layer**: JSON files containing game data and generated training samples
2. **Model Layer**: PyTorch-based sequence-to-sequence neural network
3. **API Layer**: FastAPI server exposing the model's capabilities via HTTP endpoints
4. **Client Layer**: Various client applications that can interact with the API

This architecture allows for independent development and scaling of each component, making the system flexible and maintainable.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Generation (`generate_training_data.py`)
- **Purpose**: Creates synthetic training data for the model
- **Functionality**:
  - Loads game data from JSON files (characters, weapons, domains, artifacts, team synergies)
  - Generates diverse question-answer pairs covering various game aspects
  - Organizes responses in structured JSON format
  - Creates a comprehensive training dataset with labeled query types
- **Output**: `training_data/training_data.json` containing all training samples

#### Key Functions

- `load_json(file_path)`: Loads JSON data from a file with error handling
- `save_json(file_path, data)`: Saves data to a JSON file with directory creation
- `load_data()`: Loads all game data from various JSON files
- `generate_character_queries(characters)`: Creates queries about character information, builds, and constellations
- `generate_weapon_queries(weapons)`: Creates queries about weapon stats and character compatibility

- `generate_team_synergy_queries(team_synergies)`: Creates queries about team compositions and rotations
- `generate_team_composition_queries(characters)`: Creates queries about building teams around specific elements or roles

#### Query Generation Techniques

The script employs several techniques to create diverse, realistic training data:

1. **Template-Based Generation**: Using predefined templates filled with game data
2. **Variation Creation**: Generating multiple phrasings for similar questions
3. **Structured Responses**: Creating consistent JSON response structures for each query type
4. **Categorization**: Labeling each query with a specific type for easier model training
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensuring all game aspects are represented in the training data

#### Data Flow

1. Game data is loaded from source JSON files
2. Each generation function creates queries for its specific domain
3. All queries are combined into a single dataset
4. The dataset is saved as a JSON file
5. A summary of the dataset is generated and saved

### 2. Dataset Management (`dataset.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles data loading and preprocessing for model training
- **Key Class**: `GenshinAssistantDataset` (extends PyTorch's `Dataset`)
- **Functionality**:
  - Loads training data from JSON files
  - Builds and manages vocabulary with special tokens
  - Converts text to tensor representations
  - Implements tokenization, padding, and truncation
  - Saves vocabulary for inference use

#### Class Structure

```python
class GenshinAssistantDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data_file, max_length=512):
        # Initialize dataset with data file and max sequence length
        # Load training data
        # Build vocabulary
        # Process data into tensors
        
    def __len__(self):
        # Return number of samples
        
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Return specific sample by index
        
    def build_vocab(self, data):
        # Build vocabulary from all words in dataset
        # Add special tokens
        # Create word-to-index and index-to-word mappings
        
    def process_data(self, data):
        # Convert text data to tensor format
        # Tokenize queries and responses
        # Convert tokens to indices
        # Apply padding and truncation
        
    def save_vocab(self, file_path):
        # Save vocabulary to JSON file for inference
```

#### Special Tokens

The dataset uses several special tokens for sequence processing:
- `<PAD>`: Padding token (index 0)
- `<UNK>`: Unknown word token (index 1)
- `<BOS>`: Beginning of sequence token (index 2)
- `<EOS>`: End of sequence token (index 3)

#### Data Processing Steps

1. **Loading**: Training data is loaded from JSON file
2. **Vocabulary Building**:
   - All unique words from queries and responses are collected
   - Special tokens are added
   - Word-to-index and index-to-word mappings are created
3. **Tokenization**:
   - Queries and responses are split into words
   - Special tokens are added (BOS at start, EOS at end)
4. **Conversion to Indices**:
   - Words are converted to their corresponding indices
   - Unknown words are mapped to the UNK token
5. **Padding and Truncation**:
   - Sequences shorter than max_length are padded with PAD tokens
   - Sequences longer than max_length are truncated
6. **Tensor Creation**:
   - Processed data is converted to PyTorch tensors
   - Input tensors (queries) and target tensors (responses) are created

#### Vocabulary Management

The vocabulary is a critical component that bridges training and inference:
- During training, it's built from the training data
- During inference, it's loaded from a saved file
- It ensures consistent tokenization between training and inference
- It handles out-of-vocabulary words with the UNK token

### 3. Model Implementation
- **Key Class**: `GenshinAssistant` 
- **Architecture**: Encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence model
- **Features**:
  - Embedding layer for text representation
  - Encoder for processing input queries
  - Decoder for generating responses
  - Support for lightweight inference mode

#### Model Architecture

```python
class GenshinAssistant(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, failover=False):
        super(GenshinAssistant, self).__init__()
        
        # Embedding layer shared between encoder and decoder
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        
        # Encoder (GRU-based)
        self.encoder = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        
        # Attention mechanism
        self.attention = Attention(hidden_dim)
        
        # Decoder (GRU-based with attention)
        self.decoder = nn.GRU(embedding_dim + hidden_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        
        # Output layer
        self.out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size)
        
        # Failover mode for lightweight inference
        self.failover = failover
        
    def forward(self, src, tgt, teacher_forcing_ratio=0.5):
        # Forward pass for training
        # Implements teacher forcing
        
    def encode(self, src):
        # Encode input sequence
        # Return encoder outputs and final hidden state
        
    def decode_step(self, decoder_input, hidden, encoder_outputs):
        # Perform one step of decoding
        # Apply attention mechanism
        # Return output and new hidden state
```

#### Key Components

1. **Embedding Layer**:
   - Converts word indices to dense vectors
   - Shared between encoder and decoder
   - Dimension: `embedding_dim` (typically 256 or 512)

2. **Encoder**:
   - GRU-based recurrent neural network
   - Processes input query sequence
   - Produces encoder outputs and final hidden state
   - Hidden dimension: `hidden_dim` (typically 512 or 1024)

3. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - Allows decoder to focus on relevant parts of input
   - Implements dot-product attention
   - Computes attention weights and context vector

4. **Decoder**:
   - GRU-based recurrent neural network with attention
   - Generates response tokens sequentially
   - Uses previous hidden state and attention context
   - Hidden dimension: `hidden_dim` (same as encoder)

5. **Output Layer**:
   - Linear projection from hidden state to vocabulary
   - Produces probability distribution over vocabulary
   - Dimension: `vocab_size`

#### Training Process

During training, the model uses teacher forcing:
- With probability `teacher_forcing_ratio`, the ground truth token is used as input to the decoder
- With probability `1 - teacher_forcing_ratio`, the model's own prediction is used
- This technique helps stabilize training while allowing the model to learn from its mistakes

#### Inference Process

During inference, the model generates tokens autoregressively:
- The encoder processes the input query
- The decoder starts with the BOS token
- For each step, the decoder generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary
- The token with the highest probability is selected
- The selected token is fed back as input for the next step
- Generation continues until the EOS token is produced or max length is reached

#### Failover Mode

The model supports a lightweight inference mode:
- When `failover=True`, certain computationally expensive components may be simplified
- This allows for faster inference with slightly reduced accuracy
- Useful for deployment on resource-constrained environments

  - `generate_response()`: Processes queries and generates responses
- **Features**:
  - Handles tokenization and tensor conversion
  - Implements greedy decoding for response generation
  - Converts model output to structured JSON when possible
  - Provides command-line interface for testing

### 5. API Server (`api_server.py`)
- **Purpose**: Exposes the model via HTTP endpoints
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/query` (POST): Processes user queries and returns responses
  - `/health` (GET): Provides system health status
- **Features**:
  - Loads model on startup
  - Validates requests using Pydantic models
  - Handles errors with appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Configurable server settings

## Inference Process

### Model Loading (`load_model` function in `test_model.py`)
- **Input**: Paths to model checkpoint and vocabulary file
- **Process**:
  - Loads vocabulary from JSON file
  - Initializes `GenshinAssistant` model with appropriate dimensions
  - Loads trained weights from checkpoint
  - Sets model to evaluation mode
- **Output**: Initialized model and vocabulary dictionary
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses `failover=True` for lightweight inference
  - Loads model to CPU by default (`map_location='cpu'`)

### Response Generation (`generate_response` function in `test_model.py`)
- **Input**: Model, vocabulary, and user query text
- **Process**:
  - Tokenizes query using vocabulary
  - Converts tokens to tensor representation
  - Encodes query using model encoder
  - Generates response tokens sequentially using decoder
  - Converts output tokens back to text
  - Attempts to parse as JSON
- **Output**: Structured response (JSON object) or fallback text response
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses greedy decoding (selecting highest probability token)
  - Implements early stopping when EOS token is generated
  - Has configurable maximum response length
  - Handles special tokens (`<BOS>`, `<EOS>`, `<UNK>`)

### Inference Workflow

1. **Query Preprocessing**:
   - Query text is tokenized by splitting on whitespace
   - Special tokens are added (`<BOS>` at start, `<EOS>` at end)
   - Tokens are converted to indices using vocabulary
   - Unknown words are mapped to `<UNK>` token
   - Tensor is created and shaped for model input

2. **Encoder Processing**:
   - Input tensor is passed through embedding layer
   - Encoder processes embedded input
   - Encoder outputs and hidden state are captured

3. **Decoder Generation**:
   - Decoder starts with `<BOS>` token
   - For each step (up to max_length):
     - Current token is embedded
     - Decoder processes token with previous hidden state and encoder output
     - Highest probability token is selected as next token
     - If `<EOS>` token is generated, generation stops
     - Otherwise, token is added to response

4. **Response Formatting**:
   - Generated token indices are converted back to words
   - Words are joined to form response text
   - System attempts to parse response as JSON
   - If parsing succeeds, structured JSON is returned
   - If parsing fails, plain text is returned in a simple JSON wrapper

### Error Handling
- Handles vocabulary mismatches with `<UNK>` token
- Provides graceful fallback for non-JSON responses
- Uses try-except blocks to catch and report errors

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `torch.no_grad()` to disable gradient calculation during inference
- Implements lightweight model option for faster inference
- Uses greedy decoding for efficiency (no beam search)

## Performance Optimization

### Model Optimization Techniques

1. **Quantization**
   - Convert model to int8 precision
   - Reduces memory footprint and improves inference speed
   - Example:
     ```python
     quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
         model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
     )
     ```

2. **Pruning**
   - Remove unnecessary weights
   - Reduce model size with minimal accuracy impact
   - Focus on layers with redundant parameters

3. **Knowledge Distillation**
   - Train a smaller "student" model to mimic the larger "teacher"
   - Achieve similar performance with reduced size
   - Useful for deployment on resource-constrained devices

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Process multiple queries in a batch
   - Improves throughput for high-traffic scenarios
   - Requires careful implementation in the API server

### API Server Optimization

1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Use FastAPI's async capabilities
   - Process multiple requests concurrently
   - Example:
     ```python
     @app.post("/query")
     async def process_query(query: Query):
         response = await asyncio.to_thread(generate_response, model, vocab, query.text)
         return ModelResponse(response=response)
     ```

2. **Response Caching**
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Implement LRU cache for efficient memory usage
   - Example:
     ```python
     from functools import lru_cache
     
     @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
     def cached_generate_response(query_text):
         return generate_response(model, vocab, query_text)
     ```

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
   - Distribute traffic evenly
   - Implement health-based routing

4. **Connection Pooling**
   - Reuse database connections
   - Reduce connection overhead
   - Implement connection limits

### Memory Management

1. **Garbage Collection**
   - Explicitly call garbage collection after processing
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Example:
     ```python
     import gc
     
     def process_with_gc(query):
         result = generate_response(model, vocab, query)
         gc.collect()
         return result
     ```

2. **Tensor Management**
   - Use `torch.no_grad()` for inference
   - Explicitly free tensors when no longer needed
   - Move tensors to CPU when not in active use

3. **Batch Size Tuning**
   - Find optimal batch size for your hardware
   - Balance between memory usage and throughput
   - Consider dynamic batch sizing based on load
